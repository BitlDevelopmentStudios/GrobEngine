# GrobEngine
A FNA-based framework that allows games to be created just with scripts.

As of right now, this is a work-in progress. Things may be added or removed if need be.

This repo is currently under the LGPL v3 licence.

## Features:
- Flexible: GrobEngine is fully reliant on scripts, allowing for users to create their own unique codebases.
- Expansive: The full FNA API is available at your fingertips, allowing for endless possibilities.
- Moddable from the ground up: As the framework is fully reliant on scripts, modders can use the full .NET API to deliver new custom content to players.
- Stable: The framework has built-in error detection, allowing programmers to figure out what is wrong with their scripts.
- Cross-Platform: As the framework is based off of FNA, it can be ported to many platforms such as PC, Mac, Linux, and major consoles.
